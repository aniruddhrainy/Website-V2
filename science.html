                            ago.</span></h2>

                    <p class="lead-text reveal">The apps on your phone were designed last Tuesday. By teams of brilliant
                        engineers whose entire job is to exploit the gap between your ancient brain and modern
                        technology.</p>

                    <p class="reveal">This isn't a metaphor. Your brain evolved to respond to novelty, social
                        validation, and variable rewards — mechanisms that kept your ancestors alive in the wild. Every
                        notification, every infinite feed, every autoplay video is reverse-engineered from these same
                        survival instincts.</p>

                    <blockquote class="science-quote reveal">
                        "We've built a world that our brains were never designed to navigate. And then we blame
                        ourselves for struggling."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p class="reveal">Consider what you're up against:</p>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Variable-Ratio Reinforcement</strong>
                            The same unpredictable reward pattern used in slot machines. Your feed sometimes shows
                            something amazing, sometimes nothing — and your brain can't stop pulling the lever.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Dopamine Loops</strong>
                            Each notification triggers a dopamine hit — not from the content itself, but from the
                            anticipation of what it might be. Your brain becomes addicted to the possibility, not the
                            reality.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Social Validation Triggers</strong>
                            Likes, comments, and follower counts exploit the same neural circuits that helped our
                            ancestors survive in tribal communities. Your brain processes a "like" the same way it
                            processes social approval from your tribe.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Infinite Content Design</strong>
                            No ending, no breaks, no natural stopping point. These feeds are deliberately designed to
                            eliminate the "closing signal" your brain needs to disengage.

                            Your PFC — the brain region responsible for impulse control, planning, and decision-making —
                            weakens with each interrupted task. After 20 minutes of social media, it performs measurably

                            seconds. Shorter than a goldfish. Your brain is being trained to never focus on one thing.

                            of deep, restorative sleep phases — even if you use a blue light filter.

                            rates of anxiety, depression, and feelings of social isolation — particularly in 18-35 year
                            olds.

                    <p class="reveal">The compounding effect is what's truly alarming. Each day of overconsumption makes

                        weaker. By introducing a physical barrier between you and your phone's most addictive apps, it
                        creates the one thing software solutions can't: a real moment of friction.</p>

                    <p class="reveal">Here's why that friction matters, according to behavioral science:</p>

                            By requiring a physical action (walking to the device and tapping your phone), Tyme Boxed
                            creates an "if-then" barrier that disrupts automatic behavior patterns. This principle has
                            been validated across 200+ peer-reviewed studies.

                            Adding a tangible step between impulse and action breaks the dopamine-driven autopilot loop.
                            When you have to physically move to a different location, your conscious brain re-engages.
                            The impulse often dissolves in the 15 seconds it takes to walk across the room.

                            Accessing distractions becomes the effortful choice, not the easy one. This is the same
                            principle behind putting healthy food at eye level and junk food on the top shelf.

                        require motivation. It doesn't require you to be a different person. It simply changes the
